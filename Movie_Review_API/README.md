# Movie Review API

## Project Overview
The **Movie Review API** is a backend solution built using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). This API allows users to submit, view, and manage movie reviews, including rating movies and posting comments. It serves as a foundation for any application that requires user-generated content on movie reviews and ratings.

  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Apply migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Create a superuser (for admin access):

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Configuration

- **Environment Variables**: Set up the required environment variables, such as `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`, and database settings.
- **Settings**: Update the `settings.py` file to configure installed apps, middleware, and authentication backends as necessary.

## Usage

### Run the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Access the API:
Hereâ€™s how you can update your README file to include the full URLs for each of the API endpoints, prefixed with `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. This will make it clear to users how to access each endpoint:
